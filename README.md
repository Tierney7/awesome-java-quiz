# Matt's awesome-javascript-quiz

## Description
My goal was to create a functional, user friendly, JavaScript quiz with clean and proper code. Motivation was to help others learn about Java Script in a fun setting. 
## Installation
This project is special beacuse i learned alot about javascript obisouly.  Questions which we had touched on a little before. Decarling variables. Creating event listeners and buttons. Making wrappers. The main thing i really learned from and had to spend alot of time on was the clock/timer. starting at a certain number, stopping at zero. As well as deducting 10 seconds for wrong answers. Some other things like overflow. Which looks great for loading lots of highscores, using a scroll bar to navigate. i enjoyed using new fonts, and diving back into css. 
This was also my first project with multiple pages. Easy to do, just had to pay extra attention to my file and folder orginization.
